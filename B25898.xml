            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>OF late, that every Body was talking of Trade, and of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching the Nation thereby, you may remember, how often you and I have Discoursed about the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Company, and considered what Advantages might accresce to the whole Kingdom by it, and how glad we were to see our Countrey-Men fall into that Road of Trading, which they had so long neglected. On this Occasion we also talked of the <hi>Bank,</hi> but you did not seem so satisfied about that, and thought that it might be a Cheat and Contrivance of some People to bubble the Nation out of its Money; And consequently, that it ought to be discouraged. You may remember also, that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Defence of it several times, but in the Hurry of Company, and Heat of Discourse, People do generally mistake one another, which was the Occasion of my giving you the Trouble of this at a time, that it may be useful, it being the Common Talk that the present <hi>Parliament</hi> is to have it under their Consideration.</p>
            <p>It is a received <hi>Maxim</hi> by all who understand the Good of a Kingdom, that the <hi>Abatement,</hi> or <hi>Lowering</hi> of <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> is the Advancing of Trade, this Sir <hi>Josiah Child</hi> has sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, and it is certainly true, that we may guess at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a Nation is in, by enquiring only at what Interest the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney goes. That thereby the Value of <hi>Land Estates</hi> will become greater, and consequently that of the whole Kingdom is evident, and which must be an Effect of the Increase of Riches, and of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Trade, they alwayes going of necessity together, as Sir <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> has very well observed; But the bringing down of Interest of Money by Law, is a thing that will neither do the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; On the contrary, that it will be pernicious to the Kingdom, can be easily made out, notwithstanding of all the Busle that Gentle-Men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206888:3"/> makes about it: The Ingenious Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> has done it, t<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> have not seen his Book, however it seems to be so clear, that I sh<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> easily convince you of it in very few words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Money</hi> is nothing else but a <hi>Commodity agreed upon by the unanimous Consent of most Nations, to be the common Barter of all others,</hi> the price whereof, like that of any other Commodity, doth rise and fall in a place in proportion to it's scarcity and plenty, and what we call the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> is nothing but a price for the use of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. Now they that can or will give the best price for any Commodity, will have it notwithstanding the opposition of any Laws, or interposition of any Power: Of such Force, Subtilty and Power is the General course of Trade. This Sir <hi>Josiah</hi> has upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother account, but I wonder he would not apply it to the business in question, which would have satisfied him of his Error, if he had. We see when there is scarcity of Grain, that no Law can bring it to such a price as the Poor can afford, nor when there is great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can any Law keep it up at such a Standard as Country-Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be at: In a word, all things of that Nature will keep their own Natural course, we may stop their Current for a while, but they must at last in spite of all opposition come to their own Level, tho with a great deal of more confusion and disturbance. Suppose there was a Law made for low interest, the effect of it would be, That honest plain-dealing people would lose by it, and the <hi>Crafty Jewish Traffiquers</hi> in Money, a set of men that never deserved of the Country, and in well governed places were alwayes discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aged by Laws, would be the only gainers by it, they borrowing Money by vertue of the Law at low interest, and lending it out at high, which never could be prevented as long as people stood in need of Money when there was scarcity of it. As for example, How easie were it to give a Bond for 100 <hi>lib:</hi> bearing the Legal interest, when in effect there was no more given by the lender then 90? We saw lately in <hi>England</hi> a thing very like this, When the <hi>Guineas</hi> were brought down from the Extravagant Rate they went for, by an Act of Parliament, which was as carefully and cautiously made as the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206888:3"/> Wisdom of that Nation could contrive: But how ineffectual it was, <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>very body now knows, and might have foreseen as long as there was scarcity of other good Current Money. One common way they had to elude the Act, was, <hi>By laying a Wager with one you knew had Guineas of</hi> 15 lib; For Example, <hi>That he should not get you a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for</hi> 22 <hi>shillings,</hi> He that had them won his wager, which was the same as if he had got 25 for the piece of them. Besides, if Money were by a Law at a low Interest, by no equity could people be restrained from raising it, that they might lay it out to better Advantage, which would break most of the Landed Men, unless Money were a great deal more plentiful, which will only be the true and genuine cause of a low interest.</p>
            <p>What I have said is in order to prove the usefulness of the <hi>Bank</hi> to the Nation, that being the main Scope of my Letter, and which would be too tedious if I should insist upon what I hinted at before, to wit, That a low interest of Money would advance Trade, it being certain, that when people could not live upon the common interest of their Stock, they would apply it to Trade, or if they did not, they must retrench their way of living, and spend less of Forraign Commodities and Manufactories, which how much that would contribute to the enriching of the Nation, every body knows that considereth what is laid out that way; So I shall prove that the <hi>Bank</hi> can do that which the Parliament can never do, other wayes then by preserving the priviledges of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then, It is plain that there can be no other way of Lowering of interest of Money, than by making it more plentiful, and this I say is really done by the <hi>Bank,</hi> the Money of the Nation being actually multiplyed by <hi>Bank-bills,</hi> And that this is not at all an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary but a real multiplication of Money is evident, if we consider that so much of the current Money of the Nation, as is necessary for the making of payments between Man and Man, is in effect so much dead and lost stock to the place, let the Money be never so good, when it is confined to the passing amongst our selves, it is no better than <hi>Counters</hi> or <hi>Taillies.</hi> Now the <hi>Bank-bills</hi> supplying the place of Money in making of payments, that which was a dead actionless
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206888:4"/> Stock before is now capable to be Traded with, and may be re<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned as so much really added to the Riches of the Nation. We<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> bring it to a pretty near computation of how much is gained by<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> if we suppose, and that I think safely enough, that one Third a<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> most of the Money is sufficient to make the small payments which cannot be so conveniently done by <hi>Bank-bills;</hi> Now if we reckon all the Money in this Kingdom to be about 8, or 900000 <hi>lib: Starl:</hi> which Judicious Men do reckon it will amount to 300000 <hi>lib.</hi> may do the business of small payments, and 600000 <hi>lib:</hi> may be traded with, or in effect added to the Stock, if any Body quarrel this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, I am content to call our whole Money but 600000 <hi>lib:</hi> and so 400000 <hi>lib:</hi> will be gained, which is as much as is Signed for in the Books of the <hi>Affrican</hi> and <hi>Indian Company,</hi> and which is look't on as a very considerable part of the Riches of the Nation. And by the by, I cannot but wonder that any Body that doth wish Well to our Forraign Trade, should exclaim against the <hi>Bank,</hi> it being most evident, that nothing can or will better advance it than a low Interest of Money, which cannot be better effectuated, than by keeping up of the <hi>Bank;</hi> Neither can ever the Notes or Bills of any Trading Company supply the place of Money, except it be for a small Summ, and a very short time, for besides the possibility of their Breaking, it does not seem so convenient for their own Good, for certain it is, that as soon as any unlucky hit fell out, that every Body that had their Bills, would bring them upon them, which must inevitably cause great Confusion in their Business, and vast Disadvantage to the Company. Now this cannot be supposed of the <hi>Bank,</hi> which can never break, unless it should be the Fate also of the whole Nation, it being alwayes intrinsically and really worth more than the Bills given out by it, so that as long as there is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the Nation, they may have it, If the <hi>Bank</hi> were supposed (which is not very credible) to be put to a pinch, upon the same real Securitys the Bills were given out upon by the Directors.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. There is another very great Advantage by it, and which I judge is very obvious to every Body, and that is the Facilitating
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206888:4"/> of <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>yments thereby, and the saving a Man of a great deal of time <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> trouble in receiving of Money, which is so considerable, that <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e are few who would not give ½ or ⅓ <hi>per cent,</hi> to be saved of <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y considerable Summ.</p>
            <p>There is another Way by which the <hi>Bank</hi> Enriches the Nation, and which is an easie Consequence from what is said, and that is by augmenting the Currency of Money, which it must necessarly do, both by Facilitating Payments, and making it more Plentiful, so that a Merchant may raise his Stock to Trade with it anew in half the time he could do before, which is in effect, the doubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to him; It being certain that he that returns his Stock twice in one year, gains as much as if he returned the double of it only once in the same time.</p>
            <p>There is also a very considerable encouragement to Thriftiness by it, and consequently of advantage to the Nation, which is, that the <hi>Bank</hi> is content to be payed back again in partial payments, by which a man that lives within his yearly Revenues, may insensib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crumble away his debt, which he cannot so easily do when he is owing any considerable Summ to a private person, who will not readily take it, unless he have it altogether, which the Debitor cannot do in a great many years, so that he even layes aside thoughts of it, and spends yearly what he has of free Incomes, and is Chamberlain for the rest to his Creditors.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, The Objections against the abatement of intetest of Money by any sort of method, are so triffling, that I think them scarcely worth answering, however they are buzz'd in every bodys Ears, by the Rich Usurer sort of men, the only Drons of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who without doing any thing for the good of the Publick, or having any other business than that of persecuting their wretched Creditors, do suck the very Vitals of the Kingdom, to the utter ruine of Trade, And consequently to the impoverishing of every body in the Nation besides themselves. These make a heavy cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour about <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans,</hi> that lowering their Interest, is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206888:5"/> taking their bread from them: Now what a small part of the peop<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> in the Nation, such make, it is easie to compute? Sir <hi>Josiah Chil<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
